# Usage 

Run command: 

```
$ npm install screeps-typescript-declarations --save
```

Include declaration file in your typescript compiler (usually tsconfig.json), "files" attribute.

```json
"files": ["./your_sources_folder/**/*.ts", "./node_modules/screeps-typescript-declarations/dist/screeps.d.ts"],
```

# Usage

Note: When using this API, you can't access creeps in manner suggested in Screeps' tutorial: 

```
Game.creeps.Worker1  // This is not allowed by TypeScript compiler
```

Instead, you have to use 

```
Game.creeps['Worker1']
```

# Contribute

This library will stay up to date only with the help of you! If active players don't update it, it'll get lost.

To update the declarations, edit the files in ./src folder. 

To compile the declarations, run:

```
npm run compile
```
